# Lead-management-system
1️⃣ Lead Collection
Users enter potential leads through the frontend form.
The data is sent to the backend, where it is stored in MongoDB.
2️⃣ Lead Scoring Mechanism
Each lead is assigned a score based on predefined criteria:
High interaction (e.g., multiple visits, inquiries) → Higher Score
Purchase intent (e.g., adding items to cart) → Moderate Score
Follow-up needed (e.g., inactive for a while) → Lower Score
3️⃣ Lead Organization
Leads are sorted hierarchically in descending order of score.
Businesses can focus first on high-score leads who are more likely to convert.
4️⃣ Automated Messaging
Leads receive automated follow-up messages based on their scores.
Businesses can configure custom messages for different lead categories.
